Question 2:
Explanation:

Observations within the same program : 
-When physical memory size is large(like 200 frames), OPT and clock algorithm generally generate very high hit rate, and OPT’s will be just slightly higher than clock’s.
-When physical memory size if large(like 200 frames), OPT and clock have significant higher hitting rates than LRU and FIFO
-When physical memory size is small(like 50 frames), OPT, clock, FIFO, LRU will have the moderate strong and similar hitting rates(60% to 70% + )
-Generally speaking, the physical memory size has very small effect on hitting rate for FIFO and LRU algorithm.
-Generally speaking, the physical memory size has relatively large effect on hitting rate for OPT and clock algorithm.
-For the same program/process ,the smaller the physical memory size is, the lower the hitting rate will each page replacement algorithm generate
Reasons for the above observations : 
OPT is the best algorithm for sure, since it rationally analyzes the least referenced physical frame, and it assumes that it knows about the future situations of paging, thus selecting the longest-time-used-again one to be evicted, while FIFO is just generally removing the oldest one, LRU is replacing the frame that is used the least in the past(past is really a bad prediction for the future), and clock is basically looping over frames as circular buffer, replacing the frame once finding it unreferenced(indicated by reference bit of the corresponding pte_t).

Since size of VIRTUAL ADDRESS spaces for the same program is generally fixed, thus the larger the size of physical frames => the less likely that the process will need some physical frames swapped into the disk => less page faults => higher hitting rate




Explanations of four Programs 
By analyzing the simple loop program, none of the algorithm has high hitting rate, since the program is continuously ‘appending’ value to an array(or continuously allocating new memory space) , and because every increment is 128 * sizeof(double) which is 128 * 8, thus it is very unlikely that the program will reference the same memory address more than one time, and it requires continuously new physical frames(need to get the unused one swapped in), which causes page faults => low hitting rates.

By analyzing the matmul program, which is the computing multiplication of matrix. It is convinced that both OPT and Clock page replacement algorithm will have the high hitting rate. Since matrix multiplication involves reusing the same variable again and again(based on Math common sense as well as reading code in the program). Thus no matter predicting the likelihood of page’s being referenced by analyzing the future or simply analyzing the reference bit, it BOTH benefit choosing the correct victim to evict. 
=> OPT and clock algorithm have much higher hitting rate than the other two(much fewer page faults)

By analyzing the blocked program, the four algorithm both generate high hitting rate. This is because that the programs involve matrix adding and multiplication, thus it is very likely that  1, the recently ‘come’ memory will will be referenced again 2, the referenced memory is likely to be referenced again 3, the least recently used is actually the most likely to be referenced in the future 4, It is no doubt that OPT is the best algorithm.  Thus, all four algorithm will have high hitting rate.

By analyzing the map program, since 1, the program is relatively simple and contain few lines of code 2, the program is continuously accessing or checking one(s) variables, like generic integer variables that store int value or conditional variables. 
Then, it may seldom trigger page replacement approach, which means => no page faults => high hitting rate
