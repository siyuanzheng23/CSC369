Discussion of starvation:
Starvation can happen if the monitor is not implemented correctly.
For example, when the buffer is full, arrival function is waiting on
the producer_cv, if spaces in buffer becomes available, producer_cv is signaled,
and car can arrive to lane. If that signal is never sent, the CS of arrival will never be reached
and stavation happens.
This situation of starvation actually happened to us. When we are at the early stage of testing the program,
we noticed that the program will never end. And it's caused by a never-ending thread. We use GDB to debug, and found 
out the thread stuck on arrival funtion. It's becuase when the cross function is called, and when the lane has no car,
the thread will wait for the signal of consumer_cv. So, a car has be added when cross thread can continue on. However,
at the beginning, we don't have a incoming car for the buffer to add, so arrival function get stuck because we didn't add a
proper termination when there's no incoming car for arrival. Therefore, when arrival thread is stuck, the CS of cross thread will never be reached, causing a starvation happened.
There should be more than one example where this monitor will have starvation.
